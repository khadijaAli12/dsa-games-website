## What is DSA Games?

DSA Games is not your average algorithm learning platform. It's a **gamified**, **interactive**, and **visual** playground where you can:

- **Master Sorting Algorithms**  
  Watch Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap, and other sorts come to life with real-time visualizations!

- **Navigate Complex Mazes**  
  Explore graph algorithms using pathfinding and backtracking techniques.

- **Explore DSA Concepts**  
  Experience algorithm execution through hands-on learning — no more dry theory!

- **Practice with Real Challenges**  
  Solve coding challenges and implement algorithms in our interactive playground.
